Restaurant Billing System Using Python can be very useful 
within a business environment. Instead of doing manual work 
for making up a bill at Restaurant, which gets tiring and time 
consuming, you can generate a bill including tax. When making 
up a bill manually at a Restaurant may contain some human 
errors like adding wrong items into the bill or summing up 
their total also may end up wrong, it also sometimes results 
into a Bad Impression towards the Restaurant from a 
customer. Ideally, user should be able to generate bill without 
any mistakes and quickly, enabling them to faster or improve 
their process. To overcome this problem, we have come up 
with this project, that is, Restaurant Billing System Using 
Python.
